  # ===Why are some parts(README, LICENSE) in English and some in German?===
    Well, i plan to write the whole documentation in English. But
      * my english is bad
      * it is much quicker to write it in German
      * at the moment, there are no non-German persons interested in this project.
    Any volunteers for translation are welcome.
  # ===Feature <somefeature> is missing===
